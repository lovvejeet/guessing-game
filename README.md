The Guessing Game is a simple interactive web application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It challenges the user to guess a random number within a specified range and provides feedback based on their input.

Key Features:

1.User Interface: The game presents a visually appealing user interface designed with HTML and CSS. It includes elements such as a title, instructions, input field, submit button, and feedback area.

2.Random Number Generation: The JavaScript code generates a random number within a specified range. This number is the target that the user needs to guess correctly.

3.User Input and Validation: The user can enter their guess in the input field provided. JavaScript code validates the input to ensure it is a valid number within the specified range.

4.Guess Evaluation: After the user submits their guess, JavaScript code evaluates it against the target number and provides appropriate feedback. The feedback can indicate whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

5.Game Progress Tracking: The application keeps track of the number of attempts the user has made to guess the correct number. It can display this information to the user, allowing them to track their progress.

6.Game Over and Reset: When the user guesses the correct number, the game ends and a message is displayed congratulating the user. The user can choose to play again, which resets the game, generating a new random number and resetting the attempt count.

Technologies Used:

1.HTML5: Used to structure the content and define the user interface elements.
2.CSS3: Used for styling and visual presentation of the game interface.
3.JavaScript: Used to implement the game logic, including random number generation, input validation, and guess evaluation.
